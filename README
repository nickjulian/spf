The SPF distribution includes the following files and directories:

README               this file
LICENSE              the GNU General Public License (GPL)
src                  source files
build                directory for local building; contains the Makefile

Directories you may be required to create:
bin                  directory to which compiled executables are saved
lib                  location of locally compiled libraries
include              location of locally compiled files to include

SPF makes use of the following libraries, which must be present on the 
system for which it is compiled:

  HDF5 version 1.10.5. Other versions are untested.
   <hdf5.h>

Modification of build/Makefile may be required to ensure proper library
inclusion and compiler selection.

Several executables may be compiled, differing mostly by the choice of
stochastic processes and numerical models which drive their evolution.
